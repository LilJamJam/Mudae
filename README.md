# MudaeDB
The home of my files that relate to the custom database that I made from scraping the database of the bot Mudae from Discord. These files are intended to assist users contribute to the Mudae database via polls.

A short list of files I maintain:
- OneBundle - All series that are attached to one bundle
- SuperSub - All pairs of bundles that are a subset of other bundles, includes series which are only contained within these pairs.

### I've now completed a major upgrade of my personal Mudae DB that now includes tags and aliases.

Let me know of any ideas that can help people contribute to Mudae, or other things that you're curious to see.
